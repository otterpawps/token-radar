# token-radar
Radar system for Lancer in Foundry v12
Disclaimer: I am pretty new to lancer/foundry so if I get game system rules incorrect please let me know asap.

**What does it do?** It adds a green radar scope to the top right of your screen (default, can easily be moved). The radar will dynamically show blips of other 'tokens/characters' around you. 
Currently the Radar will describe via color coding: Friendly, Unknown, and Hostile tokens. These are definable via default methods in foundry. It has 2 Range settings, using the Lancer system and manual. Check the box to use the lancer system and it will auto detect the token's SENSOR stat and make that the max range of the Radar. Or you can set it to manual and set your max range.

(see to do list for planned features). 

**Why use it?** Built specifically to expand the theatre of the mind to the vtt in Foundry. My friend's and I play this as a milsim and wanted visual features to sort of immerse ourselves with things like dynamic vision per token and of course a Radar system to describe what we can detect without as much abstraction from the GM.

**To Do List:**
- Statuses effecting Radar
- Improve visuals
- Include blip sizes based on token size
- Improve dynamic update on Radar
- Include more controls from GM to Player
- ~~Make 3 range rings with labels~~
- ~~Include color picker~~
